This is a simple terminal-based game of Black Jack. Following are the rules:

- There is a computer dealer and a human player.
- There is a deck of 52 cards.
- The human player has a bank roll which they use to place bets.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen and King) count as a value of 10.
- Aces can count as either a 1 or 11 depending on the players total.
- The objective is to obtain a hand which has a sum greater than that of the deler, but less than or equal to 21.
